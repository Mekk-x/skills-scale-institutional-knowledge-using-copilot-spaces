# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management documentation. This collection of guides provides a comprehensive framework for managing projects from inception to continuous improvement.

## Overview

OctoAcme's project management approach is built around a clear, repeatable lifecycle that takes projects from ideation to continuous improvement. Every initiative starts with a structured initiation phase, focusing on validating business need, aligning with stakeholders, establishing measurable goals, and mapping out resource requirements and key risks. This includes essential artifacts like a Project One-pager and a stakeholder communication plan. Once a project passes an explicit decision gate—based on clarity of success metrics, stakeholder buy-in, and available resourcing—it moves to planning.

During the planning phase, the cross-functional project team transforms high-level intent into an actionable backlog, defined by clear acceptance criteria, priorities, and owners. Activities include detailed kickoff meetings, estimation (using T-shirt sizing or story points), and identifying dependencies and risk items for the risk register. The team creates milestone maps and a release plan and documents its Definition of Done to ensure consistent, high-quality delivery. Transparent communication and use of shared artifacts keep everyone aligned and ready for iterative execution.

Execution and tracking combine disciplined workflows with continuous reporting and adaptation. Work is visualized on project boards with clearly defined workflow columns. Teams hold daily standups for progress and blocker surfacing, plus regular demos and reviews at the end of each sprint or milestone. Quality assurance is integral: the process requires unit, integration, and end-to-end testing, along with linting, security scans, and manual QA as appropriate. Blockers are resolved via a structured escalation process—starting at the team and escalating up to sponsors as needed. Robust reporting and dashboarding practices provide ongoing visibility into velocity and success metrics.

Roles and personas are sharply defined in the OctoAcme model. Product Managers set direction and alignment, Project Managers drive delivery and risk management, and Developers ensure technical quality and progress—all cross-collaborate via standard communication cadences and escalation paths. Stakeholder management and communication are deeply embedded, including regular updates, alignment meetings, and incident templates. After each major milestone or incident, a retrospective and action-item process ensures lessons are captured and improvements tracked, feeding a culture of continuous improvement and knowledge sharing for future projects.
